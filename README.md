# Zooplanner
Zooplanner is a system programming project that simulates the management of a zoo. 
It uses various software design patterns such as Factory, Observer, and Singleton, to achieve this. 

## System Breakdown
- The animal classes define the properties and behavior of different species of animals in the zoo.
- The animal factories are used to create objects of these animal classes.
- The observer pattern is used to keep track of changes in the state of the animals and to notify interested parties, such as zookeepers, of these changes. 
- The singleton pattern is used to ensure that only one instance of the zoo management system exists.
